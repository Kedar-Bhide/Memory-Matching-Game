# Memory Match Game

In this project, I have developed a simple card matching game. I have used the Processing library to build the Graphical User Interface and interact with the player. This game is a one player memory game in which 12 cards are initially laid face down on a surface. Each turn, the player selects two faced down cards, which are then flipped over. If the two cards
match, they remain faced up. Otherwise, they are both flipped back to face down. When the player successfully turns all the cards up, the program will declare him/her a Winner of the game.
